# FlipCards
Interactive Flip Card LMS Activity

## Notes
- Run the "flip-cards.html" file to see a working example of the activity.
- All the files developed for this activity are in the main root folder
- The "Template" folder is a copy of our LMS template. I use some of the design styles and libraries from the LMS template. (default boostrap styles, jquery library, ect..)
- The "card-test" div is hidden from the page if there is no text content entered. This is so that images placed on the cards don't have the same padding/margin that text content should and does have.
